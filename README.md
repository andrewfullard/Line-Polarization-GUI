# Line-Polarization-GUI
GUI for extracting line polarization data from spectropolarimetry FITS files

Load up the __main__.py file in Spyder or other Python editor, and run it. 
That should allow you to point to your directory of data and begin extracting line polarization in the spectra of each star. 
Then it will output text files that you can pull together, add phase information, and plot.
